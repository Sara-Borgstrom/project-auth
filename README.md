# Project Auth
Backend - created endpoints for new user, sign in and authorization. 

Frontend - forms for signing up and signing in. Connecting the pages depenting on what the user wish to do.

## The problem
We started by planning the mongoose model and the endpoints and created those. Then we planned the frontend and made some sketches for the pages and layout.

Something we would do differently if we did this project again is using Redux for handling state and React router for the different views. We would also have added more functionality to the profile page. 


## Tech and techniques
* React
* MongoDB
* Mongoose
* Node.js
* Express
* CSS


## Things to add
* Error handling for the database connection
* Specific error messages for input fields when signing up
* Error handling if user already exists
* More content for signed in users
